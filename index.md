### Hello there,

I am a third year [electrical engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca){:target="_blank"} student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca){:target="_blank"}. I have worked on various projects involving FPGA, microcontroller, and embedded system design. See some of my projects in [my portfolio](portfolio.html). Currently, I serve as the Electrical Team Lead at [UBC Sailbot](https://www.ubcsailbot.org){:target="_blank"}, where we develop fully autonomous sailboats capable of collecting research data in the Pacific Ocean.
