## Overview
- **Category:** Course Project
- **Course:** CPEN 311
- **Time:** Jun 2024

## Description
This hardware accelerator is written with VHDL and SystemVerilog for the DE1-SoC board. It is highly modular and the number of cores can be reconfigured easily with a change of 1 parameter. Overall, it can decrypt RC4-encrypted 32 byte messages with a 24-bit secret key within 1 second using a 64-core configuration.
